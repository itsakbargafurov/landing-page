# Landing Page

I created a demo version of landing page to practice HTML and CSS skills I learnt with The Odin Project 'Foundations' course.

## Skills

I have mostly used flexbox to position elements on the webpage. In addition, I practiced and acquired new CSS skills related to buttons, links, lists as well as fonts and colors.
